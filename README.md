# Physical Reward System (WIP)

A physical reward system based on the principle of classical conditioning. The system is composed of a react website, an express server, and a micro-controller. The micro-controller is connected to a few buttons and LED's that each dispatch different events through a websocket to the server. The server then broadcasts the event to all connected clients. The clients then update their state and display the new state to the user. With the system you can move through the current tasks and mark them as completed without ever having to touch your computer. In order to stimulate the user to complete the tasks, the system uses a big red arcade button that plays a different completion sound whenever a task is completed.
